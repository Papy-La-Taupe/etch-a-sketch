This project will allow us to have some simple fun.

The main goal is to cover some boxes by hovering on them, in a grid we can extend manually, and in black, %darkness or rainbowmode.

I'll instead tweak it a little bit to have a point-and-click coloring, more useful than a simple auto coloring.

I've added a color-picker, palette and storage.

The shader button works perfectly, if you use it first. if you clicked on any other color, it still does it's thing but don't increment opacity anymore.
It's non-sensical, must be because some obscure js hidden rule i litterelly couldn't care about less, so i leave it at that.

I've learned a lot on this project, but pushing it further will actually set me back in my progress since i'm fairly certain I will learn a cleaner way to aboard this problem later.

So, education first.
