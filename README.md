This project will allow us to have some simple fun.

The main goal is to cover some boxes by hovering on them, in a grid we can extend manually, and in black, white, %darkness or rainbowmode.

I'll instead tweak it a little bit to have a point-and-click coloring, more useful than a simple auto coloring.

For starters.
